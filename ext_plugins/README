This folder is someone else writing plugins
They should be compiled and then copied over to build/plugins

This is to test if the update thread can capture new plugins, and if the
zookeeper thread can run the functions within them

make an object:
g++ -I ~/playground/cpp_plugin/include -fPIC -c src/<name>.cpp -o <name>.o

then make a shared object:
g++ -shared -o plugins/lib<name>.so <name>.o
